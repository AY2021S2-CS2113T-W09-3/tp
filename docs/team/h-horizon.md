### Enhancements Contributed:

1. Implemented commands involved in manipulating Lesson objects, excluding edit lesson.<br>
   > I implemented AddLessonCommand, DeleteLessonCommand and ListLessonsCommand to add, remove and view lesson objects.
1. Implemented OpenLessonListCommand.
   > I implemented this class that allows the user to open the link, inputted when creating a lesson, in a web browser. The issue I had to resolve was that the default command to open a link in a browser was platform dependent. 
1. Implemented ViewTeachingStaffCommand
   > I implemented the command needed to view the tutor's name and email address for a particular lesson.
1. Implemented ModuleInfoCommand
   > I implemented this command to print a summary about a module. The overview consists mainly of the lessons and tasks for that particular module.   
1. Implemented commands involved in manipulating Cheat-sheet files.<br>
   > I implemented AddCheatSheetCommand, DeleteCheatSheetCommand, EditCheatSheetCommand and ListCheatSheetCommand to add, remove, edit and view Cheat-sheet files of a particular module.
1. Implemented TextEditor.
   > I implemented the TextEditor class to allow the user to input and edit cheat-sheets. A problem I faced when implementing the editor was that if the editor was used multiple times for one Gulio Session, it didn't flush data from previous files after they were closed. I then had to append the text area to null each time the text editor was invoked.

### Contributions to Documentation:

1. Documented Lesson and Cheat-sheet commands
   > For each command I implemented, I added a brief description, the command format, a sample input and the expected output.
1. Added text editor section.
   > As the one responsible for the text editor, I did the part explaining to the user how GULIO's text editor works and what he/she can do with it. WenHao added the information about the shortcuts available.

### Contributions to Developer Guide:
1. Text Editor component in Design section.
   >I wrote the description for the text editor component under Design in the DG as I was the one who implemented it in our codebase.
1.  Class diagram for the Model component in Design section.
   > I collaborated with Ivan to help him draw the class diagram for the Model component.
1. Add lesson command class in Implementation section.
   > I worked with Ivan on describing the implementation of the add lesson command under the Implementation section.
   > I drew two of the sequence diagrams for this implementation.
   
### Contribution to Team-Based Tasks:

1. Fixed minor bugs for some components.
   > Fixed minor bugs in our codebase.
1. Maintained issue tracker.
   > Maintained issue tracker by adding issues found during discussion with the appropriate labels.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide (Extracts)[Optional]

Extract of contributions:

### Editor component

**API**: `TextEditor.java`

The _Editor_ component is responsible for opening the text editor to add or edit cheat-sheets/notes. It consists of two classes:

#### Text Editor

* Sets up the text editor
* Loads existing file from Cheatsheet directory within a module for the edit cheat-sheet command
* Flushes out the text from the editor when a different or new file is opened.
* Adjusts the font size of the text within the editor
* Detects mouse input to change font style and save the text
* Saves the text from the text editor into a file

#### ShortcutListener

* Detects keyboard input for shortcuts

    <img width="973" src="../developerGuideImages/addLessonCommand.png" alt="AddLessonCommand Constructor Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 8 - AddLessonCommand Constructor Sequence Diagram
</p>

The newly created `Lesson` object is then passed to a new `AddLessonCommand` object as an argument.

<p align="center">
    <img width="973" src="../developerGuideImages/add_lesson_to_lesson_list.png" alt="execute() AddLessonCommand Sequence Diagram"><br>
    Figure 9 - execute() AddLessonCommand Sequence Diagram
</p>

`AddLessonCommand` then adds the `Lesson` object to the lesson list of a module. The lessons in the list are sorted by their lesson types each time a new lesson is added. `AddLessonCommand` also calls the `writeLesson()` method of `ModuleList` to update the change locally.

# Text Editor

GULIO comes with a built-in text-editor that allows you to edit cheat sheets directly. This text editor can be accessed via the add and edit cheat sheet commands. Cheat-sheets are stored in the ‚ÄúCheatsheet‚Äù directory within their respective module directories as ‚Äú.txt‚Äù files.

In the text editor, you can type in your notes in the text field. When done, remember to save any changes via the ‚Äúctrl-s‚Äù shortcut. To close the text editor, simply press the escape key on your keyboard. Using ‚Äúctrl-up‚Äù and ‚Äúctrl-down‚Äù, you can enlarge or shrink text respectively.
